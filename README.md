## tokio-imap: futures-based IMAP client

[![crates.io, downloads](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/tokio-imap.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-imap)
[![crates.io, latest release](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/tokio-imap.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/tokio-imap)
[![API docs, latest release](https://docs.rs/tokio-imap/badge.svg)](http://docs.rs/tokio-imap)

A [Tokio stack-based][Tokio_stack], fully asynchronous IMAP library, with strong focus on following
the relevant specs, mainly [IMAP4rev1][rfc3501], but with limited support for
the [Conditional STORE][rfc4551] extension. The type system is used to help
enforce correctness where possible. So far, there is only client code and lots
of infrastructure that supposedly could be shared -- no server yet. (If you
want a tokio-based server, look at [IMAPServer][IMAPServer].)

### Feature highlights

* Fully asynchronous by using [tokio-core][tokio-core] and [tokio-io][tokio-io]
* Uses the type system to help enforce correct operation according to spec
* [nom][nom]-based parser (in imap-proto), so far only used for server response messages

### Limitations

* Alpha-level implementation -- no tests yet, limited protocol coverage
* Server is totally unimplemented at this stage

### How to get started

Have a look at the [mailsync][mailsync] crate for example usage.

## imap-proto: IMAP types and protocol parser

[![crates.io, downloads](https://img.shields.io/crates/d/imap-proto.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/imap-proto)
[![crates.io, latest release](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/imap-proto.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/imap-proto)
[![API docs, latest release](https://docs.rs/imap-proto/badge.svg)](http://docs.rs/imap-proto)

imap-proto is a low-level IMAP protocol support crate, using the type system to
provide a safe API. It was extracted from tokio-imap into a separate crate so that
different protocol implementations can share it as common infrastructure
(as proposed by [rust-imap][rust-imap] contributors).
The code tries to closely follow the [IMAP4rev1 RFC][rfc3501], plus extensions.

Protocol support is implemented in three parts:

* Types that attempt to closely reflect specification requirements
* A parser implementation to help consume protocol messages
* Builder types to help produce protocol messages
